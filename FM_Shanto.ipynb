    "**1. Why are FM waves used more for car radios than AM waves? Do planes use FM or AM waves? Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Planes use AM waves (in particular VHF AM). AM is used so that multiple stations on the same channel can be received. (Use of FM would result in stronger stations blocking out reception of weaker stations due to FM's capture effect). The planes fly high enough that their transmitters can be received hundreds of miles away, even though they are using VHF. Interestingly, I have learned that one of the reasons for this AM adoption in planes initially was simply because of easy of instrumentation (FM was new technology and expensive hence aviation economics prevented early adaptation). \n",

    "A demodulator is an electronic circuit (or computer program in a software-defined radio) that is used to recover the information content of a modulated carrier wave. Since there are many types of modulation hence there are many types of demodulators (i.e. more than one).\n",
