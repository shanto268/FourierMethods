    "\n",
    "## Communication System\n",
    "\n",
    "In a broad sense, a \"Communication System\" refers to the sending, receiving and processing of information by electronic means. Communications started with wire telegraphy in the eighteen forties, developing with telephony some decades later and radio at the beginning of this century. Radio communication, made possible by the invention of the triode tube, was greatly improved by the work done during World War II. It subsequently became even more widely used and refined through the invention and use of the transistor, integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices. More recently, the use of satellites and fiber optics has made communications even more widespread, with an increasing emphasis on computer and other data communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processes in such communication system is concerned with the sorting, processing and sometimes storing of information before its transmission **[1]**. The actual transmission then follows, with further processing and the filtering of noise. Finally we have reception, which may include processing steps such as decoding, storage and interpretation. In this context, forms of communications include radio telemetry and telegraphy, broadcasting, mobile communications, computer communications, and so on. The functioning of such systems relies heavily on the use of amplifiers and oscillators. Such system also makes use of concepts such as noise, modulation and information theory. Fig 1. summarizes a basic communication system model.\n",

    "    <figcaption><b>Fig. 1:</b> Schematic of a basic communication system (Credit: IEEE)</figcaption>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal aim of any communication system is to convey a message. This message comes from the information source, which originates it, in the sense of selecting one message from a group of messages. Although this applies more to telegraphy than to entertainment broadcasting, for example, it may nevertheless be shown to apply to all forms of communications **[2]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information itself is that which is conveyed. The amount of information contained in any given message can be measured in bits (digitally). The greater the total number of possible selections, the larger the amount of information conveyed. It must be realized that no real information is conveyed by a redundant message. Redundancy is not wasteful under all conditions. It also helps a message to remain intelligible under difficult or noisy conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transmitter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless the message arriving from the information source is electrical in nature, it will be unsuitable for immediate transmission. Even then, a lot of work must be done to make such a message suitable. This may be demonstrated in single sideband modulation, where it is necessary to convert the incoming sound signals into electrical variations, to restrict the range of the audio frequencies and then to compress their amplitude range. All this is done before any modulation **[1,2]**. In wired systems no processing may be required, but in long-distance communications, a transmitter is required to process, and possibly encode, the incoming information so as to make it suitable for transmission and subsequent reception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Radio Transmitter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, in a transmitter, the information modulates the carrier, i.e. is superimposed on a high-frequency sine wave. The actual method of modulation varies from one system to another **[1]**. Modulation may be high level or low level, and the system itself may be amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, pulse modulation or any variation or combination of these, depending on the requirements. Figure 2 shows some common forms of wave modulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><br>\n",
    "<img src=\"mods_ex.png\" class=\"bg-primary mb-1\" width=\"480px\"><br>\n",
    "    <figcaption><b>Fig. 2:</b> Modulation examples: amplitude, frequency, and phase modulation (Credit: GOOGLE)</figcaption>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Channel – Noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is inevitable that a signal will deteriorate during the process of transmission and reception as a result of some distortion in the system, or because of the introduction of noise, which is unwanted energy, usually of random character, present in a transmission system, due to a variety of causes. Since noise will be received together with the signal, it places a limitation on the transmission system as a whole. When noise is severe, it may mask a given signal so much that the signal becomes unintelligible and therefore useless. Noise may interfere with signal at any point in a communication system, but it will have its greatest effect when the signal is weakest. This means that noise in the channel or at the input to the receiver is the most noticeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Receiver:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a great variety of receivers in a given communications system, since the exact form of a particular receiver is influenced by a great many requirements. Among the more important requirements are the modulation system used, the operating frequency and its range and the type of display required, which in turn depends on the destination of the intelligence received. \n",
    "\n",
    "Receivers run the whole range of complexity from a very simple crystal receiver, with headphones, to a far more complex radar receiver, with its involved antenna arrangements and visual display system. Whatever the receiver, its most important function is demodulation (and sometimes also decoding) Both these processes are the reverse of the corresponding transmitter modulation processes **[2]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated initially, the purpose of a receiver and the form of its output influence its construction as much as the type of modulation system used. The output of a receiver may be fed to a loudspeaker, display monitor, e.t.c for message interpretation. In each instance different arrangements must be made, each affecting the receiver design. Note that the transmitter and receiver must be in agreement with the modulation and coding methods used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communication through Frequency Modulation (FM)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, we are only interested in Frequency Modulation (FM). In this scheme, the frequency of the carrier changes in accordance with the input modulation signal as shown in Figure 2 **[3]**. Notice that in FM, only the frequency changes while the amplitude remains the same. Unlike AM, FM is more robust against signal-amplitude-fading. For this reason FM is more attractive in commercial FM radio. It can be shown that in FM, the modulated carrier contains an infinite number of side band due to modulation. For this reason, FM is also bandwidth inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "A summary of the FM schema is as follows **[2]**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The carrier frequency shifts back and forth from the nominal frequency by $\\Delta f$, where $\\Delta f$, is the frequency deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- During this process, the modulated carrier creates an infinite number of spectral components, where higher order spectral components are negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The approximate FM bandwidth is given by the  Carson’s Rule:\n",
    "    - FM Bandwidth $= 2f (1+ \\beta)$\n",
    "    - $f$ = Base band frequency\n",
    "    - $\\beta$ = Modulation index\n",
    "    - $\\beta = \\frac{\\Delta f}{f} $\n",
    "    - Frequency deviation $ = \\Delta f$\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The various signals have the following waveforms:\n",
    "    - Message Signal: $ A_m sin(2\\pi f_mt) $\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Carrier Signal: $ A_c sin(2\\pi f_ct) $\n",
    "\n",
    "    - FM Signal: $ A_c sin(2\\pi f_c t + m_i sin(2 \\pi f_mt)) $"

    "We read through the TeachSpin manual and then started playing with the \"Fourier Methods\" equipment to familiarize ourselves better with it. Once we had some idea of what each module of interest does in the Fourier Methods apparatus and how the inputs and outputs to them worked, we moved on to further investigate the Signal Generator. The Signal Generator had a very intuitive interface and we quickly learned how to generate general sinusoidals with it. We also observed that there was an option to also generate a FM signals directly from it. \n",

We realized that chapter 18 (Demodulation of FM Waves) outlined a schematic of a demodulator that used the *LCR* and *Power Audio Amp.* modules which we hadn't used in our implementation. We decided to follow the exercise of demodulation as described in chapter 18 to the T when we come to the lab next time."

It is only for this one particular example that the manual goes over for which the use of these modules are recommended so that the demodulated signal is very clean.\n",

However, we quickly ran into an issue - NRF24L01 modules can only communicate with other NRF24L01 modules. We looked at other alternatives to this arduino set up, but all our efforts were futile. It dawned on to us at the 11th hour that we can buy general purpose receiver and transmitter modules for the Arduino online, but the fastest delivery was not soon enough for us for the purposes of this lab.

    "**1. Why are FM waves used more for car radios than AM waves? Do planes use FM or AM waves? Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Very many things affect the amplitude of a radio wave, from driving under a bridge or power line, to lightning, to electrical noise from a vehicle’s spark plugs. All of these things are read as static or noise in an AM receiver. None of these things change the frequency of a radio wave. Virtually nothing does. So FM systems are impervious to the types of noise that can make AM annoying if not unusable. So for that reason it (FM waves) is a much better system for car radio systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Planes use AM waves (in particular VHF AM). AM is used so that multiple stations on the same channel can be received. (Use of FM would result in stronger stations blocking out reception of weaker stations due to FM's capture effect). The planes fly high enough that their transmitters can be received hundreds of miles away, even though they are using VHF. Interestingly, I have learned that one of the reasons for this AM adoption in planes initially was simply because of easy of instrumentation (FM was new technology and expensive hence aviation economics prevented early adaptation). \n",

    "**2. What is a frequency discriminator?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A frequency discriminator is a converter of frequency changes into amplitude changes. Another term for frequency discriminator is frequency demodulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is a demodulator? Is there more than one type?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A demodulator is an electronic circuit (or computer program in a software-defined radio) that is used to recover the information content of a modulated carrier wave. Since there are many types of modulation hence there are many types of demodulators (i.e. more than one).\n",
